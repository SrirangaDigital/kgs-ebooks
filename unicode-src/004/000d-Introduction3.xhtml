<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title"><span class="en">Sri Sharmaji and Pujya Swamiji</span></h1>
<p><span class="en">Truly, Sri K. G. Subraya Sharma has assumed the magnificent role of a <strong>spiritual emissary of Sri Sri Satchidanandendra Saraswathi Swamiji of revered memory just as Swami Vivekananda was of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="en">With a simple but attractive get up and contents which are highly profound and sublime, the book <strong>“Vedaanta Samvatsara”</strong> by Shri K. G. Subraya Sharma induced me to scan and scrutinize more than 380 tenets culled out from fourteen Upanishads. In fact, if the reader sincerely follows the directions given by the erudite and experienced scholar and imbibes the lofty spiritual teachings, he is bound to undergo a complete transformation to have a new beneficial perspective and outlook on life. The author's judicious selection of the Upanishadic Mantras pregnant with esoteric concepts and his simple, lucid, inimitable style of elucidating even the most terse verse will not fail to create a yearning desire to study the <strong>Prasthana Traya Bhashya</strong> of Adi Shankara at the holy feet of a Sadguru who is both a “Shrotriya” and “Brahmanishta” like Sri Subraya Sharma.</span></p>
<p><span class="en">I was highly elated and felt 'honoured'. I had the pleasure, nay, the fortune, of knowing Shri Sharma right from the time he stayed at the Thyagarajanagar Karyalaya with Shri Shri Swamiji, of revered memory as soon as the building was ready for occupation in early 70's. I have watched with all admiration his meteoric rise in the spiritual world soon after his Guru gave up his mortal coil in 1975. <strong>It is no exaggeration when I say that he single-handedly enhanced the reputation of Adhyatama Prakasha Karyalaya as a leading seat of pristine pure Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara. He has trekked in the footsteps of his Guru and has successfully carried foeward the task of a revival of the hoary, ancient tradition through Vedanta discourses.</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="en">I can vividly visualize memorable milestones of his spiritual achievements. For nearly four decades Sri Sharma has been giving discourses at more than half a dozen centres daily spread all over the metropolis of Bangalore and in nearby places. His physical stamina and mental will power are simply stupendous and unrivalled. His innovative genius prods and prompts helped him to come out with ever new novel devices in his relentless efforts to propagate Vedanta. He has authored many beautiful treatises, which have become very popular. <strong>His brain-child and internationally famous quarterly, 'Shankara Bhaskara', has over 20, 000 subscribers spread all over India and many Western countries.</strong> The present venture <strong>‘Vedanta Samvatsara’</strong> is a book of which more than 10, 000 copies are already sold out before publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="en">May his Guru's benign blessings and Paramaatman's divine grace grant him a long, prosperous life and induce him to achieve greater objectives in the years to come!</span></p>
