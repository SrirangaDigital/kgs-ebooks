@ENGX = Truly, Sri K. G. Subraya Sharma has assumed the magnificent 
role of a <B>spiritual emissary of Sri Sri Satchidanandendra Saraswathi 
Swamiji of revered memory just as Swami Vivekananda was of Sri Ramakrishna 
Paramahamsa.<F14D>

@ENGX1 = <$!SD>With a simple but attractive get up and contents which 
are highly profound and sublime, the book <B>``Vedaanta Samvatsara''<D> 
by Shri K. G. Subraya Sharma induced me to scan and scrutinize more 
than 380 tenets culled out from fourteen Upanishads. In fact, if the 
reader sincerely follows the directions given by the erudite and experienced 
scholar and imbibes the lofty spiritual teachings, he is bound to 
undergo a complete transformation to have a new beneficial perspective 
and outlook on life. The author's judicious selection of the Upanishadic 
Mantras pregnant with esoteric concepts and his simple, lucid, inimitable 
style of elucidating even the most terse verse will not fail to create 
a yearning desire to study the <B>Prasthana Traya Bhashya<D> of Adi 
Shankara at the holy feet of a Sadguru who is both a ``Shrotriya'' 
and ``Brahmanishta'' like Sri<N>Subraya Sharma.<F14>

@ENGX = <$!SD>I was highly elated and felt `honoured'. I had the pleasure, 
nay, the fortune, of knowing Shri Sharma right from the time he stayed 
at the Thyagarajanagar Karyalaya with Shri Shri Swamiji, of revered 
memory as soon as the building was ready for occupation in early 70's. 
I have watched with all admiration his meteoric rise in the spiritual 
world soon after his Guru gave up his mortal coil in 1975. <B>It is 
no exaggeration when I say that he single-handedly enhanced the reputation 
of Adhyatma Prakasha Karyalaya as a leading seat of pristine pure 
Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara. He has trekked in the footsteps of 
his Guru and has successfully carried forward the task of a revival 
of the hoary, ancient tradition through Vedanta discourses.<F14D>

@ENG = <$!SD>I can vividly visualize memorable milestones of his spiritual 
achievements. For nearly four decades Sri Sharma has been giving discourses 
at more than half a dozen centres daily spread all over the metropolis 
of Bangalore and in nearby places. His physical stamina and mental 
will power are simply stupendous and unrivalled. His innovative genius 
prods and prompts helped him to come out with ever new novel devices 
in his relentless efforts to propagate Vedanta. He has authored many 
beautiful treatises, which have become very popular. <B>His brain-child 
and internationally famous quarterly, `Shankara Bhaskara', has over 
20,000 subscribers spread all over India and many Western countries.<D> 
The present venture<197><B>`Vedanta Samvatsara'<D><197>is a book of 
which more than 10,000 copies are already sold out before publication.<F14>

@ENG = <$!SD>May his Guru's benign blessings and Paramaatman's divine 
grace grant him a long, prosperous life and induce him to achieve 
greater objectives in the years to come!<F14>
