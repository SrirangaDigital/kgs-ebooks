Sharma, the Blessed Disciple

@ENGX = The Vedanta literature of ancient India is a storehouse of 
wisdom and knowledge. It has a well defined purpose to remove our 
innate ignorance, so that our true nature can shine forth. The most 
advanced seekers need simply to be reminded that they are the eternal 
Atman, the <B>Supreme Brahman<D>. By simply hearing this truth, their 
misconceptions fall away. However, for the rest of<N>us, we need to 
reflect and deeply meditate on what we hear and are taught before 
we fully grasp its meaning.

@ENGX = With his unique publications in Kannada ``<B>Shaankara Samvatsara<D>'' 
and ``<B>Vedaanta Samvatsara<D>'', <B>Sri K. G. Subraya Sharma<D> 
has provided a wonderful way to allow us to undertake this necessary 
reflection and contemplation of the teachings of the <B>Vedaanta Shastra<D>, 
to allow the dawn of knowledge in us. By providing a thought for every 
day of the year, he has made it easy for all of us to follow and understand 
the ancient wisdom of <B>Vedaanta<D>.

@ENGX = I was fortunate enough to meet Sri K. G. Subraya Sharma through 
my Gurus from Mattur village. I fondly remember the many occasions 
we have conversed together in Sanskrit, discussing the works of Shankara. 
I have always been impressed with the ease with which he can explain 
the concepts of advaita with such simplicity and clarity. <B>Sri<N>K.<N>G.<N>Subraya 
Sharma, the author, has truly been blessed with the grace of his Guru, 
Sri Sri Satchidanandendra Saraswati Swamiji of Revered Memory of Holenarsipur<D>.

@ENGX = It is with great pleasure that we present to the public a 
Sanskrit edition of ``<B>Vedaanta Samvatsara<D>''. In this masterpiece, 
Sri K. G. Subraya Sharma has provided a thought for each day of the 
year from the ancient 14 Upanishads, which is then explained in clear 
and simple Sanskrit with one stanza composed by him in the simple 
Sanskrit. The reader may be tempted to assume that this book of Sanskrit 
edition may be of benefit only to scholars, and therefore may not 
be of relevance to the rest of us. However, the genius of this book 
is that it presents the profound truths of Vedanta in such straightforward, 
elegant, simple and lucid Sanskrit, that it is a great opportunity 
for anybody wishing to study Sanskrit to simultaneously study the 
language as well as the teachings of Vedanta. I wish I had such a 
book when I was learning Sanskrit in my youth! I would encourage all 
teachers of Sanskrit to seriously consider using <B>this excellent 
book as a reader for their students<D>.

@ENGX = There is a temptation to view Sanskrit as a ``non-living'' 
language. But books such as ``<B>Vedaanta Samvatsara<D>'' by <B>Vidwan 
K. G. Subraya Sharma<D>, a renowned, popular and profound Sanskrit 
scholar and a genuine Vedantin, affirm that Sanskrit is as alive and 
vibrant as ever. We should continue to encourage new original works 
in Sanskrit for future generations. We are deeply grateful to Sri 
K. G. Subraya Sharma for completing this Sanskrit translation of his 
work ``<B>Vedaanta Samvatsara<D>''.
