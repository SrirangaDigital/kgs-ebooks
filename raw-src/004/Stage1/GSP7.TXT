Men, About Bhagavad Geetha

@ENGX = I find solace in <B>Bhagavad Geetha<D> that I miss even in 
the Sermon on the Mount. When disappointment stares me in the face 
and all alone I see not one ray of light, I go back to <B>Bhagavad 
Geetha.<D> I find a verse here and a verse there and I immediately 
begin to smile in the midst of overwhelming tragedies; and my life 
has been full of external tragedies. And if they have left no visible 
or indelible scar on me, I owe it all to the teachings of the <B>Bhagavad 
Geetha<D>.

@ENGX = The <B>Bhagavad Geetha<D> deals essentially with the spiritual 
foundation of human existence. It is a call of acting (action) to 
meet the obligations and duties of life, yet keeping in view the spiritual 
nature and grander-purpose of the Universe.

@ENGX = When I read the <B>Bhagavad Geetha<D> and reflect about how 
God created this universe, everything else seems so superfluous.
