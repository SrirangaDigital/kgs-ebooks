    <span class="en">Truly, Sri K. G.

    <span class="en">With a simple but attractive get up and contents which are highly profound and sublime, the book <strong>“್ಭಓಕ್ಒಒnಠ್ಒ್ಫಒಜಡ್ಒಠ್ಟಿಒಟಒ”</strong> by Shri K. G. Subraya Sharma induced me to scan and scrutinize more than 380 tenets culled out from fourteen Upanishads. In fact, if the reader sincerely follows the directions given by the erudite and experienced scholar and imbibes the lofty spiritual teachings, he is bound to undergo a complete transformation to have a new beneficial perspective and outlook on life. The author's judicious selection of the Upanishadic Mantras pregnant with esoteric concepts and his simple, lucid, inimitable style of elucidating even the most terse verse will not fail to create a yearning desire to study the <strong>್ಧಟಒಟಿಠ್ಘ್ಒnಒ್ಬಟಒತ್ಒ್ಝಘ್ಒಟಿಘ್ತ್ಒ</strong> of Adi Shankara at the holy feet of a Sadguru who is both a ``Shrotriya'' and ``Brahmanishta'' like Sri Subraya Sharma.</span>

    <span class="en">I was highly elated and felt `honoured'. I had the pleasure, nay, the fortune, of knowing Shri Sharma right from the time he stayed at the Thyagarajanagar Karyalaya with Shri Shri Swamiji, of revered memory as soon as the building was ready for occupation in early 70's. I have watched with all admiration his meteoric rise in the spiritual world soon after his Guru gave up his mortal coil in 1975. <strong>ಉಠ್ ಔಟಿ nಈ ಓಣಒಗ್ಗ್ಓಟಒಠ್ಔಈn ಢ್ಘ್ಓn ಉ ಟಿಒತ್ ಠ್ಘ್ಒಠ್ ಘ್ಓ ಟಿಔnಗ್ಛ್ಓ್ಕೃಘ್ಒnಕ್ಓಕ್ಛ್ತ್ ಓnಘ್ಒn್ಹಓಕ್ ಠ್ಘ್ಓ ಟಓರ್ಜ್ಠ್ಒಠ್ಔಈn ಈಖ್ ಆಕ್ಘ್ತ್ಒಠ್ಜಒ್ಧಟಒಚ್ಒಟಿಘ್ಒ್ತಒಟತ್ಒಛ್ಒತ್ಒ ಒಟಿ ಒ ಛ್ಓಒಕ್ಔnಗ್ ಟಿಓಒಠ್ ಈಖ್ ರ್ಟಔಟಿಠ್ಔnಓ ರ್ಜ್ಟಓ ಆಕ್ಡ್ಒಔಠ್ಒ್ಭಓಕ್ಒnಠ್ಒ ಈಖ್ ಆಕ್ಔ್ಫಘ್ಒnಚ್ಒಟಒ.್ಢಓ ಘ್ಒಟಿ ಠ್ಟಓಚ್ಚ್ಓಕ್ ಔn ಠ್ಘ್ಓ ಖ್ಈಈಠ್ಟಿಠ್ಓರ್ಟಿ ಈಖ್ ಘ್ಔಟ್ಡಿಜ್ಟಜ್ ಒnಕ್ ಘ್ಒಟಿ ಟಿಜ್ಹ್ಹಓಟಿಟಿಖ್ಜ್ಛ್ಛ್ತ್ಹ್ಒಟಟಔಓಕ್ ಖ್ಈಟಢ್ಒಟಕ್ ಠ್ಘ್ಓ ಠ್ಒಟಿಚ್ ಈಖ್ ಒ ಟಓಡ್ಔಡ್ಒಛ್ ಈಖ್ ಠ್ಘ್ಓ ಘ್ಈಒಟತ್, ಒn್ಹಔಓnಠ್ ಠ್ಟಒಕ್ಔಠ್ಔಈn ಠ್ಘ್ಟಈಜ್ಗ್ಘ್ಭ್ಓಕ್ಒnಠ್ಒ ಕ್ಔಟ್ಹಿಈಜ್ಟಟಿಓಟಿ.</strong></span>

    <span class="en">I can vividly visualize memorable milestones of his spiritual achievements. For nearly four decades Sri Sharma has been giving discourses at more than half a dozen centres daily spread all over the metropolis of Bangalore and in nearby places. His physical stamina and mental will power are simply stupendous and unrivalled. His innovative genius prods and prompts helped him to come out with ever new novel devices in his relentless efforts to propagate Vedanta. He has authored many beautiful treatises, which have become very popular. <strong>್ಢಔಟ್ಸಿಟಒಔn್ಕ್ಹೃಘ್ಔಛ್ಕ್ ಒnಕ್ ಔnಠ್ಓಟnಒಠ್ಔಈnಒಛ್ಛ್ತ್ ಖ್ಒಜಈಜ್ಟಿ ಞಜ್ಒಟಠ್ಓಟಛ್ತ್, ‘್ಫಘ್ಒnಚ್ಒಟಒ್ಝಘ್ಒಟಿಚ್ಒಟಒ’, ಘ್ಒಟಿ ಈಡ್ಓಟ ೨೦,೦೦೦ ಟಿಜ್ಸಟ್ಹಿಟಔ್ಸಓಟಟಿ ಟಿರ್ಟಓಒಕ್ ಒಛ್ಛ್ ಈಡ್ಓಟ ಉnಕ್ಔಒ ಒnಕ್ ಜಒnತ್ಮ್ಓಟಿಠ್ಓಟn್ಹಈಜ್nಠ್ಟಔಓಟಿ.</strong> The present ventureå<strong>‘್ಭಓಕ್ಒnಠ್ಒ್ಫಒಜಡ್ಒಠ್ಟಿಒಟಒ’</strong>åis a book of which more than 10,000 copies are already sold out before publication.</span>
