    <span class="en">The Vedanta literature of ancient India is a storehouse of wisdom and knowledge. It has a well defined purpose to remove our innate ignorance, so that our true nature can shine forth. The most advanced seekers need simply to be reminded that they are the eternal Atman, the <strong>್ಫಜ್ರ್ಟಓಜಓ್ಝಟಒಘ್ಜಒn</strong>. By simply hearing this truth, their misconceptions fall away. However, for the rest of us, we need to reflect and deeply meditate on what we hear and are taught before we fully grasp its meaning.</span>

By providing a thought for every day of the year, he has made it easy for all of us to follow and understand the ancient wisdom of <strong>್ಭಓಕ್ಒಒnಠ್ಒ</strong>.</span>

    <span class="en">I was fortunate enough to meet Sri K. G. Subraya Sharma through my Gurus from Mattur village. I fondly remember the many occasions we have conversed together in Sanskrit, discussing the works of Shankara. I have always been impressed with the ease with which he can explain the concepts of advaita with such simplicity and clarity. <strong>್ಫಟಔ್ತ.್ಡ.್ಫಜ್ಸಟಒತ್ಒ್ಫಘ್ಒಟಜಒ, ಠ್ಘ್ಓ ಒಜ್ಠ್ಘ್ಈಟ, ಘ್ಒಟಿ ಠ್ಟಜ್ಛ್ತ್ಸ್ಓಓn್ಸಛ್ಓಟಿಟಿಓಕ್ ಢ್ಔಠ್ಘ್ ಠ್ಘ್ಓ ಗ್ಟಒ್ಹಓ ಈಖ್ ಘ್ಔಟ್ಡಿಜ್ಟಜ್,್ಫಟಔ್ಫಟಔ್ಫಒಠ್ಹಘ್ಔಕ್ಒnಒnಕ್ಓnಕ್ಟಒ್ಫಒಟಒಟಿಢ್ಒಠ್ಔ್ಫಢ್ಒಜಔಙಔ ಈಖ್ಪ್ಓಡ್ಓಟಓಕ್ದ್ಓಜಈಟತ್ ಈಖ್ಢ್ಈಛ್ಓnಒಟಟಿಔರ್ಜ್ಟ</strong>.</span>

    <span class="en">It is with great pleasure that we present to the public a Sanskrit edition of ``<strong>್ಭಓಕ್ಒಒnಠ್ಒ್ಫಒಜಡ್ಒಠ್ಟಿಒಟಒ</strong>''. In this masterpiece, Sri K. G. Subraya Sharma has provided a thought for each day of the year from the ancient 14 Upanishads, which is then explained in clear and simple Sanskrit with one stanza composed by him in the simple Sanskrit. The reader may be tempted to assume that this book of Sanskrit edition may be of benefit only to scholars, and therefore may not be of relevance to the rest of us. However, the genius of this book is that it presents the profound truths of Vedanta in such straightforward, elegant, simple and lucid Sanskrit, that it is a great opportunity for anybody wishing to study Sanskrit to simultaneously study the language as well as the teachings of Vedanta. I wish I had such a book when I was learning Sanskrit in my youth! I would encourage all teachers of Sanskrit to seriously consider using <strong>ಠ್ಘ್ಔಟಿ ಓಣ್ಹಓಛ್ಛ್ಓnಠ್ಸ್ಈಈಚ್ ಒಟಿ ಒ ಟಓಒಕ್ಓಟ ಖ್ಈಟ ಠ್ಘ್ಓಔಟ ಟಿಠ್ಜ್ಕ್ಓnಠ್ಟಿ</strong>.</span>

    <span class="en">There is a temptation to view Sanskrit as a ``non-living'' language. But books such as ``<strong>್ಭಓಕ್ಒಒnಠ್ಒ್ಫಒಜಡ್ಒಠ್ಟಿಒಟಒ</strong>'' by <strong>್ಭಔಕ್ಢ್ಒn್ತ.್ಡ.್ಫಜ್ಸಟಒತ್ಒ್ಫಘ್ಒಟಜಒ</strong>, a renowned, popular and profound Sanskrit scholar and a genuine Vedantin, affirm that Sanskrit is as alive and vibrant as ever. We should continue to encourage new original works in Sanskrit for future generations. We are deeply grateful to Sri K. G. Subraya Sharma for completing this Sanskrit translation of his work ``<strong>್ಭಓಕ್ಒಒnಠ್ಒ್ಫಒಜಡ್ಒಠ್ಟಿಒಟಒ</strong>''.</span>
