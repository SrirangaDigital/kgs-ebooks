<div><span class="en">I find solace in <strong>Bhagavad Geetha</strong> that I miss even in the Sermon on the Mount. When disappointment stares me in the face and all alone I see not one ray of light, I go back to <strong>Bhagavad Geetha.</strong> I find a verse here and a verse there and I immediately begin to smile in the midst of overwhelming tragedies; and my life has been full of external tragedies. And if they have left no visible or indelible scar on me, I owe it all to the teachings of the <strong>Bhagavad Geetha</strong>.</span></div>
